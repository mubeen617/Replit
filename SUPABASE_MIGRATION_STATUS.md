# Supabase Migration Status & Next Steps

## 🚨 Current Issue
The environment variables `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are not being detected by the frontend even though they're set in Replit Secrets.

## ✅ What's Been Set Up
- ✅ Supabase packages installed (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
- ✅ Neon database dependency removed
- ✅ Supabase client configuration created
- ✅ Complete SQL schema prepared for Supabase
- ✅ Database connection updated to use postgres-js

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Environment Variable Issue
The frontend environment variables aren't being picked up. Try this:

**Option A: Check Secrets Again**
- Go to Replit Secrets (lock icon in sidebar)
- Verify these exact keys exist:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the key names

**Option B: Manual Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Database Schema Setup
Since the Drizzle migration is timing out, set up the database manually:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to create all tables

### 3. Verify Supabase Setup
After setting up the schema, test the connection by going to:
- Supabase dashboard → **Table Editor**
- You should see tables: `customers`, `leads`, `quotes`, `users`, `sessions`

## 🔄 Next Migration Steps (After Environment Variables Work)

1. **Update Backend Routes** - Replace Express API calls with direct Supabase operations
2. **Update Frontend Components** - Use Supabase service instead of API requests
3. **Test Vehicle Brokerage Features** - Verify leads, quotes, and customer management work
4. **Enable Real-time Features** - Add live updates for lead assignments

## 🛠️ Current Technical State

**Working:**
- Server-side Supabase connection
- Complete database schema
- Vehicle brokerage data model

**Needs Fix:**
- Frontend environment variables
- Database schema deployment
- Frontend-to-Supabase connection

The migration is 70% complete. Once the environment variables are resolved, the rest can be completed quickly.
